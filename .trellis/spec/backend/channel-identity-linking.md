# Cross-platform Channel Identity Linking

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Use this contract when changing `/link`, `ChannelIdentity`,
`ChannelLinkToken`, trusted channel envelopes, or tenant ownership merges.
The flow is deterministic and runs before conversation persistence or Agent
execution.

## 2. Signatures

```python
LINKABLE_CHANNELS = frozenset({"telegram", "wechat"})
classify_link_argument(value: str) -> tuple[Literal["channel", "token"], str]
create_link_token(db, tenant, *, target_channel, ttl, now) -> str
consume_link_token(db, envelope, raw_token, *, now) -> TenantContext
```

Tokens are generated with `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`, persisted only as a
SHA-256 hash, expire at `expires_at`, and are consumed at most once.

## 3. Contracts

- `/link telegram` or `/link wechat` is generation syntax. The target must be
  supported and different from the current source channel.
- A value matching the generated 43-character token shape is consumption
  syntax. Unknown channel-like values fail as unsupported channels; malformed
  values fail as invalid tokens.
- Consumption validates token existence, expiry, replay state, target channel,
  source/target enabled state, then merges in one database transaction.
- The token creator's `AppUser` survives. All target identities, conversations,
  turns, pending actions, tokens and non-duplicate content move to it; channel
  conversation history remains separate.
- Duplicate content keeps one row. Merge `saved_at` using the earliest value,
  preserve distinct non-empty `why_saved` values, keep the greatest watch
  position and the more complete watch state, and prefer ready/more complete
  ingestion data. Do not interleave incompatible segment sets.
- A target `running` ingestion, or a running duplicate that would be retired,
  returns `link_merge_busy` without consuming the token. Pending/enqueued
  duplicate deliveries become no-ops after retirement.
- Production diagnostics and smoke evidence never contain raw tokens, message
  bodies, names, external sender IDs, URLs or complete identity mappings.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Result |
| --- | --- |
| unsupported/current target channel | `link_channel_unsupported` / `link_channel_current` |
| malformed, unknown, expired or replayed token | fixed invalid/expired/used result; no ownership change |
| target-channel mismatch | `link_channel_mismatch`; token remains unconsumed |
| disabled source, target or identity | `link_account_disabled`; no merge |
| same tenant already linked | idempotent success; valid token is consumed |
| different registered target | atomic tenant merge |
| running target ingestion | `link_merge_busy`; retry with the same token |
| uniqueness or ownership race | transaction rollback and `link_merge_conflict` |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- Good: an already-used target account presents a valid code and both `/whoami`
  commands return the source internal number while histories remain separate.
- Base: a fresh target account presents a valid, channel-bound code and is
  linked without invoking the model.
- Bad: treat every `/link` argument as a target channel, use display names for
  ownership, consume a code before merge commit, or move only the target
  `ChannelIdentity` while leaving tenant content behind.

## 6. Tests Required

- Unit-test argument classification, supported/current channels, token TTL,
  replay, mismatch and disabled-account fail-closed behavior.
- PostgreSQL-test registered-target merge, duplicate metadata/segment rules,
  conversation isolation, pending/token ownership and unique-key conflicts.
- PostgreSQL concurrency-test token replay, registration-vs-consumption and
  running-ingestion retry; assert at most one success and no partial move.
- ChannelService-test `/link` generation/consumption with zero Agent calls and
  stable `/whoami`; bridge smoke must verify Telegram and WeChat in both
  directions without recording secrets.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong

```python
# Every argument becomes a new target channel, so a code is generated again.
token = create_link_token(db, tenant, target_channel=argument)
```

### Correct

```python
kind, value = classify_link_argument(argument)
if kind == "token":
    consume_link_token(db, envelope, value)
else:
    create_link_token(db, tenant, target_channel=value, ttl=configured_ttl)
```
